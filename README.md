Predicting the colour of a car (Red and Blue) by training a deep convolutional neural network

Developed a deep convolutional nerual network to accurately predict the color of car by inputting a image. This script follow the Deep Learning cycle, including preoprocessing images (Scaling, Resizing, dimensionality adjustment) 

The model needs more work given the low (ish) precision after evalution.
